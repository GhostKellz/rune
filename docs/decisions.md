- **JSON-RPC 2.0**: Well-established, debuggable protocol
- **Tool Discovery**: Standardized way to expose and invoke tools
- **Transport Agnostic**: Works over stdio, TCP, WebSocket
- **Future-proof**: Extensible specification with active development

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Maximum compatibility, standardized tooling
- **Negative**: Additional protocol overhead vs direct calls
- **Neutral**: Must track MCP specification updates

## ADR-003: Provider Abstraction with Trait Objects

**Date**: 2024-01-XX
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: Core Team

### Context
Need unified interface for multiple AI providers (Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) with different APIs and capabilities.

### Decision
Use Zig's comptime polymorphism to create a trait-based provider system.

### Rationale
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time interface checking
- **Performance**: Zero-cost abstractions, no vtable overhead
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new providers
- **Uniform API**: Single interface for all providers
- **Error Handling**: Unified error types across providers

### Implementation
```zig
pub const Provider = struct {
    ptr: *anyopaque,
    vtable: *const VTable,
    // Methods use function pointers for runtime polymorphism
};
```

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Clean API, high performance, type safety
- **Negative**: More complex than direct calls
- **Neutral**: Need careful error type design

## ADR-004: FFI Layer for Cross-Language Integration

**Date**: 2024-01-XX
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: Core Team

### Context
Need integration with existing Rust ecosystem (OMEN, GhostFlow) and other languages.

### Decision
Provide C ABI FFI layer with generated bindings for target languages.

### Rationale
- **Universal Interface**: C ABI works with all languages
- **Performance**: Direct function calls, no serialization overhead
- **Rust Integration**: Seamless integration with existing Rust projects
- **Memory Management**: Clear ownership semantics across language boundaries
- **Async Support**: Can expose async operations via callbacks

### Implementation
- Static library with C headers
- Rust bindings generated via bindgen
- Python/Go bindings via cgo/ctypes
- Manual memory management at FFI boundary

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Maximum language support, high performance
- **Negative**: Manual memory management, binding maintenance
- **Neutral**: Need careful API design for safety

## ADR-005: SIMD Optimizations for Text Operations

**Date**: 2024-01-XX
**Status**: Planned (Alpha)
**Deciders**: Core Team

### Context
Text processing (search, selection, diff) is critical path for editor integration performance.

### Decision
Implement SIMD-accelerated text operations with runtime CPU feature detection.

### Rationale
- **Performance Target**: >3Ã— faster than pure Rust implementations
- **Responsiveness**: <1ms selection latency for large documents
- **Hardware Utilization**: Leverage AVX2/NEON on modern CPUs
- **Fallback Support**: Scalar implementations for older hardware

### Implementation Plan
```zig
src/simd/
â”œâ”€â”€ text_search.zig     # SIMD pattern search (AVX2/NEON)
â”œâ”€â”€ utf8_ops.zig        # UTF-8 validation and conversion
â”œâ”€â”€ hash_compute.zig    # Fast hashing for content
â””â”€â”€ diff_engine.zig     # SIMD-friendly diff algorithm
```

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Hardware-class performance, competitive advantage
- **Negative**: Increased complexity, platform-specific code
- **Neutral**: Need comprehensive benchmarking

## ADR-006: Work-Stealing Thread Pool for Parallelism

**Date**: 2024-01-XX
**Status**: Planned (Alpha)
**Deciders**: Core Team

### Context
Large workspace operations (file scanning, analysis) need parallelization for responsiveness.

### Decision
Implement work-stealing thread pool with lock-free queues.

### Rationale
- **Scalability**: Efficient work distribution across cores
- **Responsiveness**: Non-blocking operations for UI threads
- **Resource Efficiency**: Threads sleep when no work available
- **Load Balancing**: Work stealing prevents thread starvation

### Implementation
```zig
pub const ThreadPool = struct {
    workers: []Worker,
    global_queue: LockFreeQueue(Task),
    shutdown: AtomicBool,
};
```

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Scalable performance, efficient resource usage
- **Negative**: Complex implementation, debugging challenges
- **Neutral**: Need tuning for optimal performance

## ADR-007: LRU Cache with Disk Persistence

**Date**: 2024-01-XX
**Status**: Planned (Alpha)
**Deciders**: Core Team

### Context
Analysis results, file contents, and API responses benefit from caching to reduce latency.

### Decision
Implement LRU cache with optional disk persistence and SIMD-accelerated lookups.

### Rationale
- **Performance**: Sub-microsecond cache lookups
- **Persistence**: Survive process restarts
- **Memory Efficiency**: LRU eviction prevents unbounded growth
- **Cache Invalidation**: File system events trigger cache updates

### Implementation
```zig
pub const Cache = struct {
    memory: LRUCache(K, V),
    disk: ?DiskBacking,
    hasher: SIMDHasher,
};
```

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Dramatically improved repeat operation performance
- **Negative**: Complex cache invalidation logic
- **Neutral**: Need careful tuning of cache sizes

## ADR-008: Benchmark-Driven Development

**Date**: 2024-01-XX
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: Core Team

### Context
Performance is a key differentiator; need objective measurement and regression detection.

### Decision
Implement comprehensive benchmarking with CI integration and performance targets.

### Rationale
- **Objective Measurement**: Quantifiable performance claims
- **Regression Detection**: CI fails on performance regressions
- **Optimization Guidance**: Identify bottlenecks and measure improvements
- **Competitive Analysis**: Compare against Rust and other implementations

### Implementation
- Microbenchmarks for core operations
- End-to-end benchmarks for realistic workloads
- CI integration with performance comparison
- Automated regression detection

### Performance Targets
- File operations: >3Ã— Rust baseline
- Selection latency: <1ms
- Memory allocations: <100Î¼s for 1KB
- JSON parsing: Near-C performance

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Objective performance validation, prevents regressions
- **Negative**: Additional CI overhead, benchmark maintenance
- **Neutral**: Need careful benchmark design for reliability
