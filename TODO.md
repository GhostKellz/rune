## MVP âœ…
Goal: Deliver a feature-complete, high-performance Rune core with essential MCP tooling ready for integration experiments.

### Core Platform
- [x] FFI boundary (`src/ffi.zig`, `include/rune.h`) with error codes, versioning, and thread-safety guarantees
- [x] Memory subsystem (`src/memory.zig`) covering arena + pool allocators with tracking hooks
- [x] Zero-copy buffers (`src/buffer.zig`) including ring buffer, rope scaffolding, and memory-mapped file support
- [x] SIMD-friendly string engine (`src/strings.zig`) with UTF-8 validation, line index, Boyer-Moore & Aho-Corasick search

### Essential MCP Tools
- [x] File operations module (`src/tools/file_ops.zig`) with mmap reader, batch loader, incremental saver, watcher, metadata cache
- [x] Text selection engine (`src/tools/selection.zig`) supporting multi-cursor, history, zero-copy extraction, visual modes
- [x] Workspace operations (`src/tools/workspace.zig`) for fast enumeration, symbol indexing, parallel search, relationship mapping

- [ ] Provide lock-free queues or ring buffers for tool pipelines
- [ ] Parallelize workspace scans & diagnostics pipelines with configurable concurrency limits
- [ ] Expose affinity tuning APIs for Glyph to hint CPU pinning strategies

### Caching Layer
- [ ] Build `src/cache.zig` with LRU cache supporting invariant hashing & SIMD lookup
- [ ] Add disk-backed persistence for large analyses with eviction policies
- [ ] Implement cache invalidation hooks for file system events
- [ ] Instrument cache hit/miss metrics for later telemetry ingestion

### Compression & Serialization
- [ ] Add `src/compress.zig` with fast compression (e.g., LZ4/Zstd) for large payloads
- [ ] Support streaming compression for incremental responses
- [ ] Define binary serialization for high-volume MCP messages & diffs
- [ ] Provide benchmarking harness to compare serialization strategies

### Alpha Exit Criteria
- [ ] Alpha feature set implemented with regression benchmarks recorded
- [ ] Performance deltas documented vs MVP baseline
- [ ] API stability review ensuring no breaking changes required post-Alpha

---

## Beta ðŸš§
Goal: Deliver a polished developer experience, thorough testing, and seamless integration with Glyph.

### Glyph Integration
- [ ] Automate Rust binding generation from `include/rune.h` (bindgen + CI artifact)
- [ ] Publish safe Rust wrapper crate (`glyph-rune`) with ergonomic APIs and error translation
- [ ] Configure build system for cross-platform static/dynamic linking (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- [ ] Integrate Rune into Glyphâ€™s tool orchestration flow with sample MCP commands

### Testing & Quality Assurance
- [ ] Achieve >90% unit test coverage for public Zig APIs (FFI, tools, utilities)
- [ ] Add integration tests exercising Glyph â†” Rune flows (read, edit, diagnostics, search)
- [ ] Introduce performance regression harness with golden thresholds
- [ ] Run long-haul stability tests (24h continuous load) to detect leaks & drift
- [ ] Stand up fuzzing/quickcheck suite for FFI boundary and parsers

### Documentation & Developer Experience
- [ ] Produce end-to-end tutorial (Markdown + screencast outline) for adding new MCP tools in Rune
- [ ] Document tuning knobs (thread pool sizing, cache policies, SIMD toggles)
- [ ] Expand examples/ folder with realistic client+server demos
- [ ] Provide troubleshooting guide for common integration pitfalls

### Beta Exit Criteria
- [ ] All blocking bugs resolved; bug backlog triaged by severity
- [ ] Beta adopters (internal) successfully run Glyph+Rune in daily workflows
- [ ] Release readiness review signed off by engineering & product stakeholders

## Theta ðŸš§
Goal: Harden the platform for production workloads with observability, distributed capabilities, and operational tooling.

### Distributed & Collaborative Features
- [ ] Implement advanced rope/CRDT structures with incremental parsing support
- [ ] Explore Tree-sitter or LSP integration for language-aware tooling
- [ ] Add distributed cache options (e.g., Redis/KeyDB integration layer)

- [ ] Add structured logging with correlation IDs across FFI boundary
- [ ] Implement tracing spans for major tool operations (OpenTelemetry compatible)
- [ ] Provide health check and diagnostics endpoints callable from Glyph
- [ ] Deliver operational runbook covering deployment, scaling, rollback procedures

## Release Candidate Cycle (RC1 â€“ RC6) ðŸš§
Goal: Drive a disciplined stabilization cadence with clear acceptance gates for each RC. Duplicate checklist per RC as needed.

### RC Preparation (applies to each RC)
- [ ] Tag RC build from release branch with changelog and semantic version bump
- [ ] Run full automated test + benchmark matrix on supported platforms
- [ ] Execute manual spot checks for top 5 MCP workflows (read, edit, search, diagnostics, batch ops)
- [ ] Freeze new feature development; accept critical fixes only
- [ ] Publish draft release notes and upgrade guidance

### RC Exit Criteria (per iteration)
- [ ] All critical/major bugs discovered in RC resolved or deferred with explicit sign-off
- [ ] Performance metrics meet or exceed Beta baselines
- [ ] No regressions in Glyph integration smoke tests
- [ ] Documentation updates merged and staging docs site refreshed

_Repeat the RC loop (RC1 through RC6) until exit criteria can be met without new critical regressions._

---

## Release ðŸš§
Goal: Ship Rune publicly with confidence and ensure long-term support readiness.

### Final Launch Tasks
- [ ] Finalize semantic version (1.0.0 or appropriate) and tag release in git
- [ ] Publish artifacts: static libraries, headers, Rust crate, documentation site, Docker images if applicable
- [ ] Announce release (blog post, community channels, internal comms)
- [ ] Deliver migration guide from MVP/Alpha/Beta builds to GA
- [ ] Archive RC documentation and update support SLAs

### Post-Release Support
- [ ] Establish bug triage cadence and community support process
- [ ] Stand up metrics dashboard for production usage monitoring
- [ ] Plan 1.0.x patch cadence and roadmap for 1.1/1.2 features
- [ ] Gather feedback from early adopters to prioritize next iterations

### Release Exit Criteria
- [ ] No P0/P1 issues outstanding within two weeks of launch
- [ ] Support & operations teams trained and on-call rotations updated
- [ ] Product/leadership sign-off on launch impact review
